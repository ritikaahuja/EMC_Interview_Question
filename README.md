LRU Cache Question Implementation using Java 8

Implemented a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache using HashMap and Linked List.
The data structure supports the following operations:
1. get(key) - To get the cached value associated with the key in the data structure.
2. set(key, value) - To set a value in the cache associated to a specific key. If the value is not cached previously, the data structure
will insert the value of that key in the cache.
